            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Based on the Civilization 2.0 concept, our philosophy combines scientific thinking, humanitarian principles, and evidence-based action to bring positive change to society. We envision a world where technology serves humanity, education is accessible to all, and communities thrive in harmony with their environment.</p>
                <p>Our approach is grounded in three core principles: rational inquiry, compassionate action, and sustainable innovation. We believe that lasting change requires addressing root causes rather than symptoms, and that solutions must be co-created with the communities they are meant to serve.</p>
