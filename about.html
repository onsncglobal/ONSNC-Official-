            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Based on the Civilization 2.0 concept, our philosophy combines scientific thinking, humanitarian principles, and evidence-based action to bring positive change to society. We envision a world where technology serves humanity, education is accessible to all, and communities thrive in harmony with their environment.</p>
                <p>Our approach is grounded in three core principles: rational inquiry, compassionate action, and sustainable innovation. We believe that lasting change requires addressing root causes rather than symptoms, and that solutions must be co-created with the communities they are meant to serve.</p>

    <!-- FOUNDING STORY -->

            <h2>Founding Story</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>What started as a vision in village Dhuli Moradiring, Pabhoi road, Biswanath, Assam, has grown into ONSNC Foundation — a structured initiative working with communities, experts, and volunteers to transform ideas into meaningful action. Our founder, Shivanta Ronghang, recognized the need for an organization that could bridge the gap between scientific innovation and grassroots implementation.</p>
                <p>From humble beginnings with small community workshops, we have expanded to multiple states, impacting thousands through our educational programs, sustainable development projects, and scientific outreach initiatives. Our journey is a testament to the power of vision, perseverance, and collaborative effort.</p>
